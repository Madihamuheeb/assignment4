    <summary >what is DNS - Domain Name System</summary>
    <p>DNS is like a directory which links the domain name to the IP address of the server.
       <br> very server must have a unique IP address which clients can use to connect with it over the internet
     <BR>This IP address is mapped to a human friendly domain name to make it easy to remember
 <br>The directory is maintained by “name servers”. Programs can exchange the domain-name for the registered IP address by requesting the name server. This is called a “DNS lookup”
